## 📖 About The Repository

This repository serves as a collection of diverse Python implementations, demonstrating the power of Python in various domains. From solving complex **Linear Algebra** problems to creating interactive **GUI Games** and implementing real-time **Gesture Recognition** using Computer Vision.

It is perfect for beginners looking for code examples or developers looking for modular snippets for larger projects.

## 🌟 Project Showcase

### 1. 🖐️ AI Gesture Recognition & Finger Counter
**Tech Stack:** `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`
A real-time computer vision script that detects hands via webcam and counts the number of fingers held up.
*(Ideally, place a GIF or Screenshot of the Finger Identifier here)*
`![Finger Counter Demo](path/to/your/screenshot.png)`

### 2. 🎵 Gesture-Controlled Music Player
**Tech Stack:** `Pygame`, `Tkinter`, `MediaPipe`
A GUI music player that allows you to control playback using hand gestures or standard on-screen buttons.

### 3. 📉 Mathematical Graph Plotter
**Tech Stack:** `Matplotlib`, `SymPy`, `NumPy`
Input any single variable function (e.g., `sin(x)`, `x**2 + 3*x`), and the program parses the expression and renders a precise mathematical graph.
